Direwolf is a personal project now, but all contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

If you find a bug in direwolf or have some good ideas:

- Go to  [GitHub “issues” tab](<https://github.com/wnanbei/direwolf>) and open a fresh issue to make relevant comments to a feature idea or a bug.
- Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published.
- Write a test which shows that the bug is fixed or that the feature works as expected.

If you need to discuss with me about direwolf, you can send me a e-mail.
