Because I am not a native English speaker, please tell me in the Issues if there is something wrong or unclear in the introduction.

- Open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.
- Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published.
- Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected.
